front end:

- fix spec files in angular (look at updated signup page spec)
- front end tests
- finish image post to database (and add tags), show image and click submit to close window
- view all images in closet 
- build outfit

flow:
closet/build -> modal to add photo

notes: before merging run ng test and ng build --prod
