Observables
what is it: commmonly used Angular feature

purpose: an observer can subscribe to 'watch' a service

how it works:
- create Observable instance that describes subscribe() function
- subscriber function determines how to obtain/generate values/messages to be published
- calling subscribe method returns a Subscription object that comes with an unscubscribe method

potential applications to our project: 
- page loads what it can and since pictures may be slower, the picture will show up when
it has been loaded
